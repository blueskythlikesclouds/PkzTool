# PkzTool

Incredibly simple tool to create .pkz archives. Does not support extraction or compression.

## Usage

```
PkzTool [source] [destination]
```

If you don't specify the destination, a .pkz file with the same name as the input directory is going to be created automatically. This allows you to simply drag and drop a folder onto the executable file.
